Healthcare Fraud Detection Project 
**Objective:** Detect potential fraudulent healthcare providers using Medicare billing data.  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Problem Statement
Fraudulent billing is a major concern in healthcare.  
This project aims to identify providers who submit unusually high charges compared to standardized Medicare amounts.

 Dataset
- 100,000 healthcare provider records  
- Columns include provider details, service counts, Medicare charges, etc.
- Key columns used: `Average Submitted Charge Amount`, `Average Medicare Standardized Amount`, `Number of Services`, `Gender`, `Provider Type`.

Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in `Gender` with 'Unknown'  
- Converted numeric columns stored as objects to float  
- Removed infinite values in `Std_Charge_Ratio`  
- Created target variable `Fraud_Flag_Std`

Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized fraud distribution  
- Checked fraud ratio by provider type and gender  
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features

Feature Engineering
- Std_Charge_Ratio = Submitted Charge / Standardized Amount  
- Created additional numeric features like Services per Beneficiary

Fraud Prediction Model
- Model: Random Forest Classifier  
- Features: Numeric columns like Average Submitted Charge, Medicare Standardized Amount, Number of Services  
- Split: 80% training, 20% testing  
- Class imbalance handled with `class_weight='balanced'`

Results
- Accuracy: 92% (example)  
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
- Feature importance shows which features are most predictive of fraud.

Future Work
- Include categorical features like Gender, Provider Type using one-hot encoding  
- Try XGBoost or LightGBM for better performance  
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash or Streamlit
