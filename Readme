  📊 <strong>Dataset</strong><br>
  100,000 healthcare provider records including provider details, service counts, and Medicare billing information.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🧹 <strong>Data Cleaning</strong><br>
  Handled missing values, converted numeric columns, removed infinite values, and created a fraud target variable.
</p>

<p align="center">
  📈 <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong><br>
  Analyzed fraud distribution, provider type patterns, gender-based trends, and feature correlations.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🧠 <strong>Feature Engineering</strong><br>
  Created charge ratio metrics and additional derived features to improve fraud detection accuracy.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🤖 <strong>Fraud Prediction Model</strong><br>
  Built a Random Forest Classifier with balanced class weights and an 80–20 train-test split.
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✅ <strong>Results</strong><br>
  Achieved approximately 92% accuracy with clear identification of high-risk fraud indicators.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🚀 <strong>Future Enhancements</strong><br>
