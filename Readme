# 🏥 Healthcare Fraud Detection Project

## 📌 Objective
Detect potential fraudulent healthcare providers using Medicare billing data by identifying abnormal billing patterns.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---
## ❓ Problem Statement
Fraudulent billing is a major concern in the healthcare industry.  
This project aims to identify providers who submit **unusually high charges** compared to **standardized Medicare amounts**, helping flag high-risk providers for further investigation.

---
## 📊 Dataset
- 100,000 healthcare provider records  
- Includes provider details, service counts, and Medicare billing information  
- **Key columns used:**
  - `Average Submitted Charge Amount`
  - `Average Medicare Standardized Amount`
  - `Number of Services`
  - `Gender`
  - `Provider Type`

---
## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in `Gender` with **"Unknown"**  
- Converted numeric columns stored as objects to **float**  
- Removed infinite values from `Std_Charge_Ratio`  
- Created target variable **`Fraud_Flag_Std`**

---
## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized fraud vs non-fraud distribution  
- Analyzed fraud ratio by **provider type** and **gender**  
- Generated correlation heatmap for numeric features
